# Machine-Learning-ADS-504


We are working on the data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. (UCI, 2014). https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank%2BMarketing 


The dataset contains attributes such as marital status, education, outcome, the target variable (y/ Deposit), etc. We try to find any possible patterns of relationship between these attributes with the term deposit to make a classifier which can predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. This task will assess the marketing team to focus more on potential customers, finding the most important features that have an impact to attract the new customers for future campaigns and improve their strategy.
